* Installation

First, you need to clone the repository into a local directory by doing
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  git clone https://github.com/xgarrido/TestCalorimeterCalibration.git
#+END_SRC
This implies to have =git= binary installed on your computer[fn:9d942c13]

Then, =cd= into you =TestCalorimeterCalibration= directory and create a =build=
directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mkdir -p build; cd build
#+END_SRC

Then, configure your installation by using =cmake= command /i.e./
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  cmake \
      -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<falaise installation dir.> \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ..
#+END_SRC
This will check for =Falaise= installation directory and install
=TestCalorimeterCalibration= library into a dedicated directory =../install=.

Given the =cmake= configuration has worked without errors, you finally have to do
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  make install
#+END_SRC
